    <p>The adaptive <b>educational systems</b> within e-learning platforms are built in response to the
        fact that the learning process is different for each and every learner. In order to provide
        adaptive e-learning services and study materials that are tailor-made for adaptive learning, this type of educational approach seeks to combine the ability to comprehend and
        detect a personâ€™s specific needs in the context of learning with the expertise required to
        use appropriate learning pedagogy and enhance the learning process. Thus, it is critical to
        create accurate student profiles and models based upon analysis of their affective states,
        knowledge level, and their individual personality traits and skills. The acquired data can
        then be efficiently used and exploited to develop an adaptive learning environment. Once
        acquired, these learner models can be used in two ways. The first is to inform the pedagogy proposed by the experts and designers of the adaptive educational system.</p>
